MiniShell - Linux Command Line Interpreter
Overview

MiniShell is a simplified implementation of the Linux Shell developed in C using Linux System Calls.

The project demonstrates how a real shell like bash accepts user commands, creates child processes, executes programs, manages jobs, handles signals, and controls foreground/background execution.

This project helped me understand the internal working of Linux process management and Operating System concepts rather than just using terminal commands.

Problem Statement

Whenever we type commands like

pwd
ls
cat file.txt
sleep 10 &

Linux executes them immediately.

As an Embedded/Linux Engineer, I wanted to understand:

How does Linux execute commands?
How are child processes created?
What happens when Ctrl+C is pressed?
How are background jobs managed?
How does the shell know whether to wait or accept another command?

This curiosity motivated me to build my own MiniShell.
